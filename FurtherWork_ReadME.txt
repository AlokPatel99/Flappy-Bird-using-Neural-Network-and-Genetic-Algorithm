Following work can be done further: (By Alok)
1) Rectangles need to be updated with the pipes, the images are available in the Images folder.
   Random selection of the pipes can be done as I did in background.
2) Score display can be displayed using the number images available in the folder. 
3) Images contains the three version of the bird image: Lower, Middle, and the Upper Flap. 
   This can be implemeneted.
4) You can also experiment the different pixel values, where it is required to test the different 
   configurations, and the optimum value can be placed.
5) If we look at the 1hr video I send you eariler, there when the bird hit pipe, then it drops down,
   we can also do this if you want.

- I am getting this much thing in my mind, feel free to do other things you like to implement
  in game which looks good for the game.
