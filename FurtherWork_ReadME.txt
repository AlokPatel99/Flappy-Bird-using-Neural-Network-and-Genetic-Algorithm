Following things need to do for comparison:
1) Make the game fast.
2) Check the crossover functions, change the relavent things if you like.
3) Add more crossover functions.
4) Change in the activation functions for experiments.
5) Also, changing the input parameters to make the agent learn fast.


Following work can be done further:(At the end when all things are done)
1) Rectangles need to be updated with the pipes, the images are available in the Images folder.
   Random selection of the pipes can be done as I did in background.
2) Score display can be displayed using the number images available in the folder. 
3) Images contains the three version of the bird image: Lower, Middle, and the Upper Flap. 
   This can be implemeneted.
4) If we look at the 1hr video I send you eariler, there when the bird hit pipe, then it drops down,
   we can also do this if you want.
